## What is this app ?
This is an app to share reibun(which means exmaple sentences in Japansese) for language learners so that they can understand how phrase is used in daily life.


## Why I create this app?
- I have studied English words for long time with vocabulary books but it is difficult to remember all of them since it's endless.

- The example sentences in those books have are sometimes useful, but we don't use them in daily conversation. Seeing example sentences from others colud help us to understand how to use phrases.

- Making own exmalple sentences is good way to memorize phrases

From above reason, I decided to create app which allows app user to
-  create own example
-  see example created by others
